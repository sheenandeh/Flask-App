# PROJECT 1: DOCKER CONTAINERIZATION CHALLENGE
**Nebulance Systems BootCamp DevOps Class2025A**


## 📌 Project Summary

This project is about building and deploying a **Flask Visitor Counter Web Application**. Every time someone visits the webpage, a counter goes up by one and stores this data in a **MongoDB** database.

You are not just building the app — you are **containerizing it using Docker and Docker Compose** so it can run anywhere, anytime.

---


## ✅ Expected Outcome

- Web app running at: `http://localhost:5050`
- Big counter showing number of visitors
- Buttons to:
  - Refresh and count visits
  - View health and metrics
  - Reset counter
- Data stored in MongoDB and persists even after restarting
- Clear MongoDB connection status shown on the interface

---


## 📚 Key Terms Explained

- **Flask** – A Python tool used to build simple web apps.
- **Python** – A general-purpose, beginner-friendly programming language.
- **Visitor Counter** – Keeps track of how many people visit the page.
- **MongoDB** – A database that stores data in JSON-like format.
- **PyMongo** – Python tool that lets Flask communicate with MongoDB.
- **Bootstrap** – Makes the web interface responsive and modern.
- **Docker** – Packages your app and its environment in a “container.”
- **Dockerfile** – A script that tells Docker how to build the container.
- **Docker Compose** – Helps run multiple containers (Flask + MongoDB) together.
- **Volume** – Keeps MongoDB data safe even when containers stop.
- **Environment Variables** – Configurable app values in a `.env` file (like DB name, port).
- **Health Check** – Confirms the app and DB are working.
- **Graceful Degradation** – If MongoDB is down, the app still loads but shows a degraded status.

## 🧾 .env File

Used to configure environment settings like port and database.

FLASK_ENV=development
DEBUG=True
PORT=5000
MONGODB_HOST=mongodb
MONGODB_PORT=27017
MONGODB_DB=visitor_counter

## 📦 Dockerfile

Used to build the container image for the Flask application.

FROM python:3.10-slim

WORKDIR /app

COPY requirements.txt .
RUN pip install --no-cache-dir -r requirements.txt

COPY . .

EXPOSE 5000
ENV FLASK_ENV=production

CMD ["flask", "run", "--host=0.0.0.0", "--port=5000"]





## 📂 docker-compose.yml file
Used to run Flask and MongoDB together.

version: '3.8'

services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "5050:5000"
    environment:
      - FLASK_ENV=development
      - DEBUG=True
      - MONGODB_HOST=mongodb
      - MONGODB_PORT=27017
      - MONGODB_DB=visitor_counter
    depends_on:
      - mongodb
    volumes:
      - .:/app

  mongodb:
    image: mongo:latest
    container_name: mongodb
    ports:
      - "27017:27017"
    volumes:
      - mongo_data:/data/db

volumes:
  mongo_data:' 


  

## 📜 requirements.txt
Python dependencies.
Flask==2.3.3
pymongo==4.6.0
python-dotenv==1.0.0
gunicorn==21.2.0
Werkzeug==2.3.7




## 🧪 How the App Works (app.py Summary)
•	Starts a web server using Flask.
•	Connects to MongoDB using environment values.
•	Routes include:
o	/ — Displays the homepage and updates the visitor count
o	/health — Returns JSON health status
o	/metrics — Returns visit stats
o	/reset — Resets the counter





# 🚀 STEP BY STEP DEPLOYMENT GUIDE


## 1. Open VS Code and Clone the Repo
git clone https://github.com/HILL-TOPCONSULTANCY/bootcamp-project-1.git
cd bootcamp-project-1



## 2. Check if Docker Is Installed
docker --version
You should see something like Docker version 24.0.0.



## 3. Install and start docker desktop on your local machine
In the search bar, search for docker desktop and run it as administrator
Once it launches and you see the docker icon you can go back to VS code and conitnue implentation



## 4. Build and Run the Containers
docker-compose up --build -d
## Explanation:
•	--build builds the image using Dockerfile
•	-d runs in the background



## 5. Access the Application
Open your browser and go to:
http://localhost:5050
You should see the web dashboard.



## 6. Test API Endpoints
curl http://localhost:5050/health
curl http://localhost:5050/metrics
curl -X POST http://localhost:5050/reset
Each returns a JSON response with status or data. 



## 7. Test Data Persistence
docker-compose stop
docker-compose start -d



## 8. Simulate MongoDB Failure to test data persistence
Stop MongoDB:
docker stop mongodb
Now refresh the web page. MongoDB status will show as "Disconnected" and app status will be "Degraded".
To bring it back:
docker start mongodb
Refresh again to reconnect.
This stops the container and restarts it. Visitor count should still be there — thanks to volume storage. This confirms your data persistence.



## 9. Push to GitHub
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Final flask project"
git push



## ✅ Success Criteria
•	Application loads at http://localhost:5050
•	Visitor counter increments with each visit
•	MongoDB stays connected and data is saved
•	/health, /metrics, /reset endpoints work
•	Restarting does not reset the counter



## 🧠 Learning Outcomes
You will learn to:
•	Containerize a Flask app with MongoDB
•	Use Docker and Docker Compose
•	Configure environments and dependencies
•	Set up persistent storage and service dependencies
•	Understand RESTful APIs and web app deployment



## 👨🏫 Final Notes
Take a screenshot of your app running and submit your GitHub repo.
Remember: MongoDB must persist data and all buttons should work.

You're done — congratulations on completing Project 1 of the Nebulance Systems BootCamp DevOps Class2025A!
